This is a 2D, side on platformer game inspired by games such as Terraria and Minecraft. It is a small project I am working on in my own time. 

It is not entirely my own work, credit goes to Marcus Dubreuil(https://marcusman.com) whose YouTube lessons helped explain the basic game engine concepts.
The sprites are also taken off various websites online.
